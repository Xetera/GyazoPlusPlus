# Gyazo Inspect

#### WIP: Currently working but not consistently enough to release it just yet

### How to:

Take a gyazo screenshot and... well, that's it.

The next time you're in your [gallery](https://gyazo.com/captures) it will be saved and ready to click no matter when you took it.

## Limitations:

* Does not work retroactively, only on new pictures that are taken after the extension is installed.
* You have to wait for the picture to actually load for it to get saved.
* Loading gallery sometimes does not work (will be fixed).
* Links are deleted when you uninstall the extension.
* Possibly very buggy for ninja users but then again, why are you using this if you're ninja?
